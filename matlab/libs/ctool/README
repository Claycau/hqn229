This is the ensemble classification toolbox CTOOL, which is an extension 
of "ENTOOL" a software package for ensemble regression modelling. 

Please follow the demo files in the demos/ directory to see some examples.

Please note, that the CTOOL performs only binary classification and
that the class labels have always to be -1 and 1 !!!

Multi-Class classification has to be transformed into 
several binary classification problems ! 

The CTOOL has been use in several real world applications,
read more about the toolbox and the ensemble idea in the
following papers (all available online at http://www.j-wichard.de/pub.html):
