Specification for the so called bayesS struct in gmmb_* functions.

K number of classes
D number of dimensions
C number of GMM components (class specific, can vary)
N number of data points

bayesS - struct array 1 x K
  mu D x C		mean vectors
  sigma D x D x C	covariance matrices
  weight C x 1		component weights
  apriories 1 x 1	class a priori probability


The "data" and "type" data collections:
data N x D matrix
type N x 1 vector (class label, positive integer)
type is assumed to have at least one of every integer 1, ..., K.
